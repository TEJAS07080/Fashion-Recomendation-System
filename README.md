• Developed a robust recommendation system to suggest similar and complementary clothing items tailored to the
user’s selection.
• Extracted image features from a large dataset of fashion items and utilized a pre-trained ResNet-50 model in
TensorFlow for feature analysis.
• Recommended both complementary and similar items based on the user’s current selection.
